<h1> My suggestion on 5 place to visit in Canberra </h1>
Living in Canberra for 3 years now. I'm absolutely enjoy being here.
There are lot of place I have been and many of them spot on due to the beauty and the unique of the place. 
Unlike most of other Australian, They are visit Canberra through mid Winter. It is always cold and often the sun weren't shown up. It's make people don't like to visit Canberra.<br/>
<br/>
Canberra is very peaceful and quite place but can also be very crowned in special event like: Fireworks in Griffin lake, Multi culture festival,etc.Not just in special event,there are a ton of place that is attractive to many tourist and Australian to visit when they have free-time in the right weather condition.<br/><br/>
